# Hi, Sup

I made this cool repo / code for [djs](https://discord.js.org) bots. Lemme know if i need to change anything by creating an issue in this page. Thanks!

# To start
edit the `.example.env` into `.env` and fill all the values.
Discord Developer Portal - https://discord.com/developers/applications
MongoDB :
 - Online Server : https://www.mongodb.com/
 - Community Server (Localhost) : https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
after doing all these, do `npm run dev` for development purpose or `npm run build` and `npm run start`. Hoorayy!!
